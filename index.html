OnlyGans uses a fleet of SOTA generative models to generate naked individuals which would work something like thispersondoesnotexist.com. uses some version of StyleGan to generate images and may support videos in the future. <span class="emphasis">Support this noble cause by contributing to the repo and make this world a better place to live!</span>

                <span class="project-name"><a href="https://github.com/shauray8/trachea">Trachea</a></span> - transforms your speech to a text output. It uses a simple convolution model on mel spectrograms generated by a custom library which when presented with an audio sample would create a mel spectrogram and then the pixel data would get squished and smashed by the neural network to generate a text representation of that particular sample! It was a simple project for my deep learning class that I took in college.

                <span class="project-name"><a href="http://github.com/shauray8/ctw">Context Tree Weighting</a></span> - was again a college project in which I tried implementing different compression algorithms as a baseline and then tried implementing Context Tree Weighting which was not very easy and I would like to get back to it someday maybe I can have a better understanding of how compression works!!

            <div class="project">
                <span class="project-name"><a href="https://github.com/shauray8/calib-challange">Calib-Challenge</a></span> - was a challenge organized by Comma AI. The repo contains the code for predicting the YAW and Pitch of a moving car from the dashcam video. The project kept on going after the contest as well and now it contains some very basic code for a self-driving car. Just the software part of it, there are no bound conditions yet and it just gives out raw data that has to be processed before giving it to the car's computer. Pedal is the Operating System for the same and is UNIXish. I wanna drive a fully autonomous car with this code someday (with some improvement of course!)

            <div class="project">
                <span class="project-name"><a href="https://github.com/shauray8/quadruple_inverted_pendulum/">Quadruple Inverted Pendulum</a></span> - was my first attempt at writing a research paper that failed (OF COURSE) it was pretty straight forward actually. It's basically 4 pendulums attached to one another and the task was to balance them on top of the prev pendulum without falling. But turns out calculating Lagrangian equations for this setup is pretty straightforward but has a lot of calculations and just to simulate the pendulums there are hundreds of thousands of calculations every sec. But then I found something very useful called GameGAN but again there was no open source code for that and I DROPPED THE IDEA!
