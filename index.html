      <p style="width : 72%; opacity:.7">An idiot admires complexity. A genius admires simplicity. A physicist tries to make it simple. Anything that is gaining complexity, more the idiot will admire it. If you make something more clusterfuck that he can't understand, he will think you are a god because you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That's how they write academic journals to make others think you are a genius.<br> <b>Terry Davis</b> <br><br> BUT if you want to be an Idiot <a href="some_other_index.html">here's</a> a more clusterFUCK version of this website ! <br><b> Maybe that's the reason most of us don't believe that we live in a simulation.</b></p>

        In 2022 I started streaming on YouTube just some random coding shit and programmed some useless projects live. I like keeping things raw just like this website so every video on YouTube has some kind of copyright and is stupidly insane to watch them all but it shows my raw nature when I code.

Our first major project include converting any pdf text book to it's audiobook format. You can then use if for listning to financial reports of some company, some student can use it to learn some kinda useful shit and most importantly it's open source so you don't have to pay a single dime in order to learn !!

Basically, this is what PyTorch is but way way way more complex, I wanted something not so complex but powerful enough! </div>

The repo contains the code for predicting the YAW and Pitch of a moving car from the dashcam video. The project kept on going after the contest as well and now it contains some very basic code for a self-driving car. Just the software part of it, there are no bound conditions yet and it just gives out raw data that has to be processed before giving it to the car's computer. Pedal is the Operating System for the same and is UNIXish. I wanna drive a fully autonomous car with this code someday (with some improvement course!)</div>

It's basically 4 pendulums attached to one another and the task was to balance them on top of the prev pendulum without falling. But turns out calculating Lagrangian equations for this setup is pretty straightforward but has a lot of calculations and just to simulate the pendulums there are hundreds of thousands of calculations every sec. But then I found something very useful called GameGAN but again there was no open source code for that and I DROPPED THE IDEA !</div>
