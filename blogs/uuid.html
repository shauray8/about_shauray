<p>It's time to dive into the wild, wacky, and sometimes downright infuriating world of UUIDs. Yes, those strings of alphanumeric chaos that we love to hate and hate to love We're not here to explain what UUIDs are (Google that if you must), but rather to vent, rant, and explore some wild ideas about how V7 can help in some ways, specially with S3s (S3s requires a seperate rant of it's own)</p>
<h3>A quick overview of what a mess of versions it is !</h3>
<p>I really like this illustration from <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg/'>@t3dotgg</a> and this post <a href='https://planetscale.com/blog/the-problem-with-using-a-uuid-primary-key-in-mysql'>The Problem with Using a UUID Primary Key in MySQL</a> will give you a very good explaination of how messed up this is, which basically translates to, <br> </p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>UUIDv1</b> - Uses the Gregorian calendar &#x1F937;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F; segments looks like <b>['time_low'-'time_mid'-'time_low_and_version'-'clock_seq_and_version'-'node'] </b>- now using the Gregorian calendar is not the biggest issues here, rather they had the biggest segment set to <b>'node'</b> which is the unique address of the system generating the UUID. I'm no security expert but this looks bad </li>
  <br>
  <li> <b>UUIDv2</b> - nothing intresting here, they replaced the <b>'low_time'</b> component of the UUID with POSIX user ID </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>UUIDv3 and v5</b> - they started using a <b>128bit</b> hash and both versions use a different hash MD5 and SHA1 repectively, the intresting part here is that V3 and V5 is similar but not V4, and V4 is what is widely used</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>UUIDv4</b> - this is what most of the population uses for there random keys and in my opinion this is the simplest of them all, <b>it just uses a set of random alphanumerics</b>, with an exception that the first position of the 3rd segment is always set to the version number (seen throughout the versions) </li>
  <br>
  <li><b>UUIDv6</b> - now V6 is very similar to V1 flipping the timestamps, meaning the most significant portions of the timestamp are stored first. now in turn this makes it a little more <b>sortable</b>, since the most significant portion of the timestamp is upfront</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>UUIDv7</b> - now this is the only version I can think of using in come cases instead of V4, this basically finally uses the <b>UNIX timestamp</b> instead of the Gregorian calendar and the rest of the string is just random alphanumerics, which makes it less trackable back to their source and this is what we will discuss moving forward</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>UUIDv8</b> - this permits vendor-specific implementations while adhering to RFC standards and the illustration says its more of a vibe then a standard now</li>
</ul>

<h3>UUIDv7 and Simple Storage Solutions (or databases in general)</h3>
<p style="color: red"><b>! There are very good guides on how diffusion works online this is just a sparse introduction to the diffusion process to build up the notion !</b></p>
<p>The diffusion process is an iterative mechanism that converts random noise into an image. This process can be broadly divided into two stages: forward diffusion and reverse diffusion. Let's delve into these stages to understand their technical intricacies.</p>
<h3>Trees 101</h3>
<p>Now Trees, with there hierarchical strcutre, play a pivotal role in all of computer science in my opinion also providing a backbone for storing indeces for huge databases, (If you don't know about Trees consider taking one of the MIT OCW courses on data structres), for now we will talk about B-Trees often called as balanced trees but it's not really known that the B stands for in the B-Trees, also we'll talk about B+ Trees which is a much more widely accepted data structure when storing huge amounts of data </p>

<h4>B Trees</h4>
<p>Assuming you know about BSTs, we'll work with a modification of that consider that now every node can store two keys, now you have 3 paths to take when searching for a key very similar to what you would do for a binary search tree, now to formalize this, each node in a B-Tree of order d contains at most 2d keys and 2d+1 pointers as shown below, now the keys can vary from node to node, but each must have at least d keys and d+1 pointers, such that every node is atleast half full</p>
<img src="./assets/btree.png" width='100%'></img>
<p>Balancing a B-Tree : with BST random insertions can leave a tree unbalanced which in turn makes it harder to find a key(atleast the worst case senario), with B-Trees the longest path is logdn, now with this you will never visit more then 1+logdn nodes</p>
<img src='./assets/complex.png' width='100%'></img>
<p>Insertion : First, a find proceeds from the root to locate the proper leaf for insertion. Then the insertion is performed, and balance is restored by a procedure which moves from the leaf back toward the root.</p>
<p>Deletion : Deletion in a B-tree also requires a find operation to locate the proper node. There are then two possibilities: the key to be deleted resides in a leaf, or the key resides in a nonleaf node. A nonleaf deletion requires that an adjacent key be found and swapped into the vacated position so that it finds work correctly</p>

<p>Now with these there is a notion of underflow in the leaves as a minimum of d keys is required so in order to restore the balance a key is borrowed from its neighbour, and if there are'nt enough keys to destribute a concatenate happens to restore the balance</p>

<h4>B+ Trees</h4>
<p>The reverse diffusion process, guided by a pre-trained model, aims to denoise the noisy latent variables step-by-step, eventually reconstructing a high-quality image. This is expressed as:</p>
<p>
    \(p_\theta(x_{t-1} \mid x_t, \mathbf{s}) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t, \mathbf{s}), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t, \mathbf{s}))\) where:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\mu_\theta(x_t, t, \mathbf{s})\) is the predicted mean, influenced by the current state \(x_t\), timestep \(t\), and the seed \(\mathbf{s}\).</li>
    <li>\(\Sigma_\theta(x_t, t, \mathbf{s})\) is the predicted variance.</li>
    <li>\(\mathbf{s}\) is the seed, which ensures the process is stochastic but repeatable.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p style="color: orange"><b>[Appendix A]</b></p>

<h3>Optimizing insertions for B+ Trees</h3>
<p>Moving on to the core focus of the this blog: Seeds play a crucial role in this process. Each seed initializes the random number generator that produces the initial noise and the noise added at each reverse diffusion step. Consequently, the choice of seed can lead to vastly different generated images even for the same textual description</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>To illustrate the profound impact of seeds, let's consider two examples:
<ul>
  <li>Best Seed (FID <b style="color: orange">[Appendix B]</b>: 21.60): Seed 469</li>
  <li>Worst Seed (FID: 31.97): Seed 696</li>
</ul>
These seeds were identified through extensive experimentation and analysis from the authors. The FID score, where lower values indicate higher quality, highlights how the choice of seed can significantly affect the output quality.
